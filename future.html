        <p style="text-align: center; font-style: oblique; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px blue;">Welcome to the future page, here we'll talk about my plans for the future.</P>
        <h4>Future Plans:</h4>
        <p>After graduating I plan to study more on programming, 4 hours every day. I plan to get certificates for jobs and stuff, I think my mom will help me on nursing or care aid. For now anny jobs would be satisfying for me.</p>
        <p>As for now I can't persue my Career as my mom plans to save up money. She took a student visa before we came here in Canada so she will graduate next year I think. After she graduate it is my turn to go to school. It is really sad that I can't go to any College or University this year, but I am fine with it since I can still learn programming online.</p>
        <p>I plant to make copy of website or games to enhance my coding skills and try to learn more languages. I will plan to make my own games in the future and sell them in public, its either I would be a Game Developer or a Web Developer. I coul also be a designer if I have to.</p>
        <p>I plan to visit my home town soon in the near future if I have the money for it.</p>
        <p>Yeah boiz thats my plan in the future. I think I will add more If I want to, but you'll never know.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-style: oblique; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px blue;">Thank you for reading all the way hereðŸ˜Š. I hope you like my story, I'm sorry for any miss spell I have in this or any wrong grammar I did. I'm still learning english ok??! Well anyways BYEEE!!</p>
